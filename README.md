# Python with Flask web-app 

This repository contains the Python source code and its dependencies. The idea is to build a Docker image out of this repo, and to deploy it.

This repo is designed to work with https://github.com/peshhe/assignment-terraform.

---
This README.md file is still under development.

There is an update for the Python app coming in. It will use environment variables instead of hardcoded values with preset default values in case the environment value is missing.

Stay tuned.
